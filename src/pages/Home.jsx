            on January 10, 1999 thru the collective efforts of missionary couple
            Pastor Love and Sister Racquel Tira; and pioneer members Brother
            Cesar Ocampo, and the couple Brother Mario and Sister Liz Dabu. In a
            formal inaugural service conducted at Days Hotel, attended by the
            leaders of the Conservative Baptist Association of the Philippines
            (CBAP), GCF-Ortigas, and its then senior pastor Dr. Luis Pantoja,
            Jr., GCF San Fernando was officially established to be a beacon of
            the gospel in Central Luzon with a primary goal: to â€œKNOW CHRIST AND
            MAKE HIM KNOWN."
